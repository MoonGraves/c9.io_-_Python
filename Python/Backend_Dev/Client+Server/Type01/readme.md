If user or trying from software it's fine, like <b> VsCode </b> or other, because there must need it by terminal as cmd type or just normal cmd from windows.
in this type only client need the ip-address and port protocol, because it connect type method/parameters functions.

As same time server listen coming the ip address or others. As can use multiple cmd or same as cmd - terminal type. <br>
First able active the server, then the multiple client. There will be see user laptop/pc ip-address with small id, because it's same person. <br>
This ip address is fake, just need from your pc/laptop by cmd - ipconfig (IPV4 address). <br>

In client there is small print, because user can type anything sms to sent server, because there is def send (function) + default print message. <br>
Just type keyboard the 'enter' there will be carry on the systems and default sms will be sent it to continue. <br>
<br>
After the !Disconnect, there can play multiple client, but after the ip address will be new id number anyway and server can be running all the time like endless.
